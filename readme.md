# Veloce App

## Overview

This app is a basic inventory system.  It allows a user to sign up or a login and then add a vehicle to the app's inventory.  Using the AWS S3 API, users can also upload an image to their listing.  

## Motivation

This app was a project for an assignment during my WDI course at General Assembly.  I am also a huge car fan, so that explains the "vehicles" theme. 

## Built With:
* Node JS
* Express
* PostgreSQL
* Bootstrap
* AWS S3 API

## Whats next?

* I want to improve the UX and create new table migrations that will make the listings tailored more towards the actual information required to sell a vehicle.  
* Tweaking the S3 API and inputs to take in more than one image at a time. 
* Photo Gallery 
* Improve inventory view
